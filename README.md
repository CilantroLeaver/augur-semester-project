# Welcome to Sprint 4!  
Software Engineering CS4320 Spring 2021 Final Project  
Group Members: Owen Pistolis, Walker Brownfield, Dalton Wright  

In this sprint, we present an example UI for the Augur open-source software monitoring app. Included is one table showcasing contributor data for repositories from the Augur database hosted at vmware.osshealth.io. There are also a few quality-of-life features; the ability to refresh the data table and a light/dark mode.  
To add additional functionality in the future, we could add tabs which load various API queries, make table entries clickable to see extra information, or even add API visualizations from the chromium-chromedriver-enabled community graphics.  

NOTE: Although we originally attempted to pull data from the Augur RESTful API on our own locally hosted instance, we had trouble with populating some endpoints. Therefore, we decided to make AJAX requests on an example database hosted elsewhere with the proper endpoints.  

Included is code from our local Augur frontend website.
