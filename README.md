# Welcome to Sprint 3!  
Software Engineering CS4320 Spring 2021  
Group Members: Owen Pistolis, Walker Brownfield, Dalton Wright  

In this sprint, we provide updates on our semester project to interface with the CHAOSS Augur endpoints and API.  

(text about Owen's security work on our dedicated webserver here)  
On the frontend side, we decided to forgo using Augur's official frontend as there are many bugs to work out in development. Instead, we are working on a custom frontend utilizing tables and menus styled with CSS3 and Bootstrap.  
In our meeting with Prof. Goggins on April 28th, we noted that our project scope has not shifted from the original requirements document. We still plan on serving contributor data from Augur endpoints over a custom frontend.  

NOTE: We have not yet started on our final presentation video. Work on that will happen during sprint 4.
